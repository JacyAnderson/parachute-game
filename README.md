#Game Name: Easy Company

# Concept:
#### Easy Company is a cooperative, obstacle evasion game akin to old school Frogger. In Easy Company, two paratroopers are dropped over enemy territory and must evade incoming anti-troop fire using only side to side movements as gravity slowly brings them to the ground.  

## No Trooper Left Behind
#### If one player is lost, the Team as a whole loses. Using communication and teamwork, both players must evade incoming fire by strafing right and left out of harms way until both troopers land safely on the ground.

## Controls
### Player 1:
#### Move left: "A" key
#### Move right: "D" key

### Player 2:
#### Move left: "J" key
#### Move right: "L" key

### As a Team:
#### Players cannot overlap, necessitating effective communication to strafe and avoid incoming fire. Remember: No trooper left behind!

####	- Dear diary, today I start my mission to construct my first(ish) game. My goal between now and midday tomorrow is to animate my player divs to recreate "gravity" as the players parachute down, and to create a function that allows players to move side to side while parachuting down. I SHOULD take that time to create a function that shoots random div "rockets" from both sides of the screen, but I need to test that the gravity animation and player controls work together first. This will likely bite me in the ass later: I will report back.

### Today's Successes
#### Got "players" to float down constantly, and move side to side based on player input. Created "gravity" and player input faster than I thought I would - beat my mid-day tomorrow goal.


### Today's Issues
#### - Git Hub gave me a commit conflict error, but I figured it out with git pull, git fetch, and git merge.
 - Players can overlap, and leave div due to absolute positioning. Unsure how to solve.
